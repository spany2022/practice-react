// File Extensions in React Projects: .jsx is not supported by browsers but works in React projects because of the build process that recognizes JSX code.
// Using .jsx or .js: Both .jsx and .js can contain JSX code. The choice depends on the projectâ€™s build setup. Some projects require .jsx, others use .js with JSX.
// File Imports: Some projects require the extension in imports (e.g., import App from './App.jsx'), while others do not (import App from './App').
// No Browser Impact: The file extension doesn't matter to the browser; it's a build process concern.
